# An easy knife spawning script for CS:GO!

I wrote this in essentially 30-45 minutes, because I didn't really want to deal with it constantly copying commands out.

It's not that big of a deal all things considered, but it might be nice for some other people as well.

**Big thank you to [Brum Brum](https://steamcommunity.com/id/brumbrum96) for the original guide! 
(which you can find [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1474604735))**

## Installation

1. Download / Clone this archive ([Quick little link for you lazy folks](https://github.com/dynamyc010/csgo-easy-knives/archive/refs/heads/master.zip))

2. Go to your CS:GO directory
   
   - Open your Steam, right click on CS:GO, and under *Manage* click on *Browse Local Files*

3- Pull the `csgo` directory in there.

(Feel free to check out the contents of the script, it's not much tbh)
